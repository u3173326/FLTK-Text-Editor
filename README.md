# FLTK-Text-Editor
Text editor written with FLTK and C++

Currently features find/replace, zoom, line numbers, word wrapping and copy/paste buttons.

Bugs:
- Line height does not recalculate immediately after zooming
- Find/replace window can be closed with window manager buttons, permanently removing it

Planned features:
- Highlighting
- Dialogue to reset cursor pos to 0 if search doesn't yield results
